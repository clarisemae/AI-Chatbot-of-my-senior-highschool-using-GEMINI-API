However, I can provide general guidance on how to get to Japan-Philippines Institute of Technology \u2013 Muzon Campus Inc. in San Jose del Monte, Bulacan:\n\n**1. Determine Your Starting Point:**\n\n*   Figure out where you will be traveling from. This will help you choose the best route.\n\n**2.

Public Transportation (General Options):**\n\n*   **From Manila:**\n    *   Take a bus or van going to San Jose del Monte (SJDM), Bulacan. These usually leave from terminals in Cubao or Divisoria.\n    *   Ask the driver to drop you off at Muzon in SJDM.\n    *   From Muzon, you can take a tricycle or jeepney to JPI Technology - Muzon Campus Inc. (it's on M.
